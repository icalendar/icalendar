module Icalendar
  # A Event calendar component is a grouping of component
  # properties, and possibly including Alarm calendar components, that
  # represents a scheduled amount of time on a calendar. For example, it
  # can be an activity; such as a one-hour long, department meeting from
  # 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow. Generally, an event will take up time
  # on an individual calendar.
